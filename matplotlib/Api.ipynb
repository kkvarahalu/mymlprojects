He is a white man maybe in his 40s or 50s. I had 2 Amazon packages out for delivery. I live in an apartment complex. I saw the driver pulling up in front of my apartment building, holding 3 packages and taking the stairs down to the downstairs apartments. When he was walking back up the stairs and ready to go back to his truck, I asked him where my 2 packages were that were out for delivery. He said he delivered all 3 to one of the apartments below. I ran out and quickly found out that both of my packages were dumped in front of someone else’s apartment door. I quickly retrieved them and I confronted the driver. He didn’t apologize, he said that’s where they “pinged” (whatever that means). Mind you, my packages had my full name and address on it, including MY apartment number. I was very frustrated. The driver walked away without any apology, seemingly not even understand what he did wrong.I immediately called Amazon customer service to file a report on this unprofessional driver but was met by some Indian dude who could barely speak English and the whole time he thought I have an issue with an item instead of a driver. Amazon is completely useless. There needs to be a DIRECT way to report all these unprofessional, obviously retarded and lazy drivers. Instead, Amazon keeps covering for them! \",\"reviewRating\":{\"@type\":\"Rating\",\"bestRating\":\"5\",\"worstRating\":\"1\",\"ratingValue\":\"1\"},\"publisher\":{\"@id\":\"https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1\"},\"inLanguage\":\"en\"},{\"@type\":\"Review\",\"@id\":\"https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Review/www.amazon.com/6828d97b67f9019ae02cfd85\",\"itemReviewed\":{\"@id\":\"https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.amazon.com\"},\"author\":{\"@type\":\"Person\",\"name\":\"Ian\",\"url\":\"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/58d19c310000ff000a84194d/\"},\"datePublished\":\"2025-05-17T20:46:19.000Z\",\"headline\":\"I have always found Amazon easy to work…\",\"reviewBody\":\"I have always found Amazon easy to work with and very reliable as far as quality is concerned.  i have always received items on time -or sooner\",\"reviewRating\":{\"@type\":\"Rating\",\"bestRating\":\"5\",\"worstRating\":\"1\",\"ratingValue\":\"5\"},\"publisher\":{\"@id\":\"https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1\"},\"inLanguage\":\"en\"},{\"@type\":\"Review\",\"@id\":\"https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Review/www.amazon.com/6828d1c5758344ee57d4df40\",\"itemReviewed\":{\"@id\":\"https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.amazon.com\"},\"author\":{\"@type\":\"Person\",\"name\":\"Patricia Clark\",\"url\":\"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/670e4620075286345bd0773d/\"},\"datePublished\":\"2025-05-17T20:13:25.000Z\",\"headline\":\"I have given Amazon 1 star because of…\",\"reviewBody\":\"I have given Amazon 1 star because of the lies they tell you.

Item arrived weirdly damaged, possibly deliberately damaged.Amazon wouldn\\'t even let me post a review to warn others of this seller, even when I removed the accompanying pictures it was still rejected. Wouldn\\'t be able to get a refund because loved one needed the rest of the items in the packaging as they were unwell and in pain (and would have had to wait for at least a couple, possibly several days in pain for another delivery). But I took pictures as evidence, if only to warn others and so that Amazon could make sure it didn\\'t happen again. Amazon either needs to sort out it\\'s website because it wouldn\\'t let me (publicly) post with pictures or it\\'s being ever more obnoxious not to accept evidence for a damaged product. So, if Amazon wouldn\\'t or couldn\\'t accept the review with pictures, upon removing the pictures Amazon initially \\'accepted\\' (ie it actually gave me the opportunity to post it.) the review but it was the rejected via email.So how many other people is this going to happen to? Because that damage looked like it might have been deliberate.It was a strawberry nutrition replacement meal for people recovering from stomach illness, damage, operations etc sold by Amazon and cost about £30-40. Item had several puncture wounds as if caused by a knife or scissors tip- strictly the tip and not a slicing or sawing mark. One of the drinks was also squeezed and torn. It was the strangest damage. Not for this item exclusively but posting criticism towards Amazon delivery for repeated incidents of damage, on a certain social media website has in the past led to accusations of lying or exaggerating. An aside, merely commenting on Amazon delivering items late when extra was paid to be delivered next day (even if it was needed for medical reasons) were met with \\\\\"Karen!!!\\\\\" (nevermind that I\\'ve only attempted to officially complain about damage once, as this time it was so unusual). Always by several accounts at a time- crucially claiming to work for the Amazon delivery.If they do indeed work there, for a company that supposedly treats it workers so poorly there is some cult like loyalty going on here!\",\"reviewRating\":{\"@type\":\"Rating\",\"bestRating\":\"5\",\"worstRating\":\"1\",\"ratingValue\":\"1\"},\"publisher\":{\"@id\":\"https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1\"},\"inLanguage\":\"en\"},{\"@type\":\"Review\",\"@id\":\"https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Review/www.amazon.com/6827c99525ff806d2b0eb833\",\"itemReviewed\":{\"@id\":\"https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.amazon.com\"},\"author\":{\"@type\":\"Person\",\"name\":\"Chuck Harris\",\"url\":\"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/6827c98e4db5a0a472fad0ce/\"},\"datePublished\":\"2025-05-17T01:26:13.000Z\",\"headline\":\"Getting screwes\",\"reviewBody\":\"I was contacted by the Amazon delivery driver while I was at work asking me for something called a PASS CODE which I have never heard of.

Amazon driver</h2></a><p class=\"typography_body-l__v5JLj typography_appearance-default__t8iAq\" data-service-review-text-typography=\"true\">I want to report one of the Amazon drivers who worked in Kansas City, MO today, on Saturday May 17, 2025. He is a white man maybe in his 40s or 50s. <br/><br/>I had 2 Amazon packages out for delivery. I live in an apartment complex. I saw the driver pulling up in front of my apartment building, holding 3 packages and taking the stairs down to the downstairs apartments. When he was walking back up the stairs and ready to go back to his truck, I asked him where my 2 packages were that were out for delivery. He said he delivered all 3 to one of the apartments below. <br/><br/>I ran out and quickly found out that both of my packages were dumped in front of someone else’s apartment door. I quickly retrieved them and I confronted the driver. He didn’t apologize, he said that’s where they “pinged” (whatever that means). Mind you, my packages had my full name and address on it, including MY apartment number. I was very frustrated. The driver walked away without any apology, seemingly not even understand what he did wrong.<br/><br/>I immediately called Amazon customer service to file a report on this unprofessional driver but was met by some Indian dude who could barely speak English and the whole time he thought I have an issue with an item instead of a driver. <br/><br/>Amazon is completely useless. There needs to be a DIRECT way to report all these unprofessional, obviously retarded and lazy drivers. Instead, Amazon keeps covering for them! </p><p class=\"typography_body-m__k2UI7 typography_appearance-default__t8iAq\" data-service-review-date-of-experience-typography=\"true\"><b

data-service-review-text-typography=\"true\">I have given Amazon 1 star because of the lies they tell you. Yesterday I ordered 2 items and I subscribed for the next day delivery. One of my items arrived today and my other one was meant to arrive today as well, hours later I looked to see where my parcel is. It changed from arriving today to be arriving Wednesday, I phoned them up spoken to some guy, and explained what it said then it changed. He was trying to tell me that it shows Wednesday and yes I know it does but it didn’t show that this morning, then he went to blame the company that I bought the laptop of. I wasn’t happy as I had things to do today and I waited in all day just have him saying that he will put it through ASAP, ffs what a joke. So now my plans are all over the place because of Amazon!!!  I’ve canceled my subscription because when my parcel arrives I will not be using Amazon ever again!!! </p><p class=\"typography_body-m__k2UI7 typography_appearance-default__t8iAq\" data-service-review-date-of-experience-typography=\"true\"><b class=\"typography_body-m__k2UI7 typography_appearance-default__t8iAq typography_weight-heavy__rS52U\" weight=\"heavy\">Date of experience<!-- -->:</b> <span class=\"typography_body-m__k2UI7 typography_appearance-subtle__PYOVM\">May 17, 2025</span></p></div></section></div></article></div><div><div class=\"ad-block styles_adBlock__m9bGL\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle styles_adBlockInsert__Vb1gs\" style=\"display:block\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-0509843775112688\" data-ad-slot=\"1725254079\"></ins><span class=\"typography_body-m__k2UI7 typography_appearance-subtle__PYOVM styles_adBlockAdvert__UMCLa\">Advertisement</span></div></div><div class=\"styles_cardWrapper__g8amG styles_show__Z8n7u\"><article class=\"paper_paper__EGeEb paper_square__owXbO card_card__yyGgu card_noPadding__OOiac card_square___AZeg styles_reviewCard__Qwhpy\" data-service-review-card-paper=\"true\"><div><div class=\"styles_reviewCardInnerHeader__8Xqy8\"><aside class=\"styles_consumerInfoWrapper__6HN5O\" aria-label=\"Info for Toni Stone\"><div class=\"styles_consumerDetailsWrapper__4eZod\"><span><button class=\"styles_btnWrapper__arGPQ\" aria-label=\"Toni Stone\"><div class=\"avatar_avatar__QtS0N avatar_pink__662MO\" style=\"width:44px;min-width:44px;height:44px;min-height:44px\" data-consumer-avatar=\"true\"><span class=\"typography_heading-xs__osRhC typography_appearance-default__t8iAq typography_disableResponsiveSizing__z3EGy avatar_avatarName__2WZwR\">TS</span></div><span class=\"styles_badge__oQ9m4\"><svg viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" class=\"icon_icon__RdICC icon_appearance-default__AeU7K\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"14px\" height=\"14px\"><path class=\"ic-verified-user\" d=\"M1 3a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h10a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v7.989a2 2 0 0 1-1.298 1.873l-5 1.875c-.453.17-.951.17-1.404 0l-5-1.875A2 2 0 0 1 1 10.989V3Z\"/><path class=\"ic-verified-user-check\" d=\"M11.618 6.12a.875.875 0 1 0-1.236-1.24L7.03 8.22 5.66 6.647a.875.875 0 0 0-1.32 1.15l1.768 2.03c.041.047.086.089.135.125a.875.875 0 0 0 1.364.163l4.01-3.995Z\"/></svg></span></button></span><a href=\"/users/61af73034f73080012ed0707\" rel=\"nofollow\" name=\"consumer-profile\" target=\"_self\" class=\"link_internal__Eam_b link_wrapper__ahpyq styles_consumerDetails__POC79\" data-consumer-profile-link=\"true\"><span class=\"typography_heading-xs__osRhC typography_appearance-default__t8iAq\" data-consumer-name-typography=\"true\">Toni Stone</span><div class=\"styles_consumerExtraDetails__NY6RP\" data-consumer-reviews-count=\"3\"><span class=\"typography_body-m__k2UI7 typography_appearance-subtle__PYOVM\" data-consumer-country-typography=\"true\">US</span><span class=\"typography_body-xs__IKE8N typography_appearance-subtle__PYOVM\" data-lil-dot-typography=\"true\">•</span><span class=\"typography_body-m__k2UI7 typography_appearance-subtle__PYOVM\" data-consumer-reviews-count-typography=\"true\">3<!-- --> reviews</span></div></a></div></aside><div class=\"typography_body-m__k2UI7 typography_appearance-subtle__PYOVM\"><time dateTime=\"2025-05-17T19:28:31.000Z\" class=\"\" data-service-review-date-time-ago=\"true\">17 hours ago</time></div></div><section class=\"styles_reviewContentwrapper__K2aRu\" aria-disabled=\"false\"><div class=\"styles_reviewHeader__DzoAZ\" data-service-review-rating=\"1\"><div class=\"star-rating_starRating__sdbkn star-rating_medium__Oj7C9\"><img alt=\"Rated 1 out of 5 stars\" src=\"https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg\"/></div></div><div class=\"styles_reviewContent__tuXiN\" aria-hidden=\"false\" data-review-content=\"true\"><a href=\"/reviews/6828c73f1735d28f0d5628a0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_self\" class=\"link_internal__Eam_b typography_appearance-inherit__YnCNb link_link__jBdLV link_notUnderlined__y4Qsc\" data-review-title-typography=\"true\"><h2 class=\"typography_heading-xs__osRhC typography_appearance-default__t8iAq\" data-service-review-title-typography=\"true\">They attempted to steal money from me</h2></a><p class=\"typography_body-l__v5JLj typography_appearance-default__t8iAq\" data-service-review-text-typography=\"true\">They attempted to steal money from me.

Item arrived weirdly damaged, possibly deliberately damaged.<br/><br/>Amazon wouldn&#x27;t even let me post a review to warn others of this seller, even when I removed the accompanying pictures it was still rejected. Wouldn&#x27;t be able to get a refund because loved one needed the rest of the items in the packaging as they were unwell and in pain (and would have had to wait for at least a couple, possibly several days in pain for another delivery). But I took pictures as evidence, if only to warn others and so that Amazon could make sure it didn&#x27;t happen again. Amazon either needs to sort out it&#x27;s website because it wouldn&#x27;t let me (publicly) post with pictures or it&#x27;s being ever more obnoxious not to accept evidence for a damaged product. So, if Amazon wouldn&#x27;t or couldn&#x27;t accept the review with pictures, upon removing the pictures Amazon initially &#x27;accepted&#x27; (ie it actually gave me the opportunity to post it.) the review but it was the rejected via email.<br/><br/>So how many other people is this going to happen to? Because that damage looked like it might have been deliberate.<br/><br/>It was a strawberry nutrition replacement meal for people recovering from stomach illness, damage, operations etc sold by Amazon and cost about £30-40. Item had several puncture wounds as if caused by a knife or scissors tip- strictly the tip and not a slicing or sawing mark. One of the drinks was also squeezed and torn. It was the strangest damage. <br/><br/>Not for this item exclusively but posting criticism towards Amazon delivery for repeated incidents of damage, on a certain social media website has in the past led to accusations of lying or exaggerating. An aside, merely commenting on Amazon delivering items late when extra was paid to be delivered next day (even if it was needed for medical reasons) were met with &quot;Karen!!!&quot; (nevermind that I&#x27;ve only attempted to officially complain about damage once, as this time it was so unusual). Always by several accounts at a time- crucially claiming to work for the Amazon delivery.<br/><br/>If they do indeed work there, for a company that supposedly treats it workers so poorly there is some cult like loyalty going on here!<br/><br/></p><p class=\"typography_body-m__k2UI7 typography_appearance-default__t8iAq\" data-service-review-date-of-experience-typography=\"true\"><b class=\"typography_body-m__k2UI7 typography_appearance-default__t8iAq typography_weight-heavy__rS52U\" weight=\"heavy\">Date of experience<!-- -->:</b> <span class=\"typography_body-m__k2UI7 typography_appearance-subtle__PYOVM\">May 01, 2025</span></p></div></section></div></article><div data-service-review-stack=\"true\" data-service-review-stack-count=\"2\"><button class=\"button_button__EM6gX button_s__oTr1f button_appearance-secondary__01O4M button_wide__9LE3T styles_button__dRbZ5\" name=\"review-stack-show\" type=\"button\" data-review-stack-show-button=\"true\"><span class=\"typography_heading-xxxs__SrlLa typography_appearance-inherit__YnCNb typography_disableResponsiveSizing__z3EGy button_buttonText__uWBzs\">See 1 more review by JS<svg viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" fill=\"inherit\" class=\"icon_icon__RdICC icon_appearance-inherit__MeZek\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"16px\" height=\"16px\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"m8.003 10.289 5.617-6.557.76.65-6.377 7.444L1.62 4.383l.76-.651 5.623 6.557Z\"/></svg></span></button><div class=\"styles_stack__krhvN\"></div></div></div><div><div class=\"ad-block styles_adBlock__m9bGL\"><ins class=\"adsbygoogle styles_adBlockInsert__Vb1gs\" style=\"display:block\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-0509843775112688\" data-ad-slot=\"4678720473\"></ins><span class=\"typography_body-m__k2UI7 typography_appearance-subtle__PYOVM styles_adBlockAdvert__UMCLa\">Advertisement</span></div></div><div class=\"styles_cardWrapper__g8amG styles_show__Z8n7u\"><article class=\"paper_paper__EGeEb paper_square__owXbO card_card__yyGgu card_noPadding__OOiac card_square___AZeg styles_reviewCard__Qwhpy\" data-service-review-card-paper=\"true\"><div><div class=\"styles_reviewCardInnerHeader__8Xqy8\"><aside class=\"styles_consumerInfoWrapper__6HN5O\" aria-label=\"Info for Chuck Harris\"><div class=\"styles_consumerDetailsWrapper__4eZod\"><div class=\"avatar_imageWrapper__9hWrp\" style=\"width:44px;height:44px;min-width:44px;min-height:44px\"><img alt=\"\" data-consumer-avatar-image=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"44\" height=\"44\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"1\" style=\"color:transparent\" src=\"https://user-images.trustpilot.com/6827c98e4db5a0a472fad0ce/73x73.png\"/></div><a href=\"/users/6827c98e4db5a0a472fad0ce\" rel=\"nofollow\" name=\"consumer-profile\" target=\"_self\" class=\"link_internal__Eam_b link_wrapper__ahpyq styles_consumerDetails__POC79\" data-consumer-profile-link=\"true\"><span class=\"typography_heading-xs__osRhC typography_appearance-default__t8iAq\" data-consumer-name-typography=\"true\">Chuck Harris</span><div class=\"styles_consumerExtraDetails__NY6RP\" data-consumer-reviews-count=\"1\"><span class=\"typography_body-m__k2UI7 typography_appearance-subtle__PYOVM\" data-consumer-country-typography=\"true\">US</span><span class=\"typography_body-xs__IKE8N typography_appearance-subtle__PYOVM\" data-lil-dot-typography=\"true\">•</span><span class=\"typography_body-m__k2UI7 typography_appearance-subtle__PYOVM\" data-consumer-reviews-count-typography=\"true\">1<!-- --> review</span></div></a></div></aside><div class=\"typography_body-m__k2UI7 typography_appearance-subtle__PYOVM\"><time dateTime=\"2025-05-17T01:26:13.000Z\" class=\"\" data-service-review-date-time-ago=\"true\">1 days ago</time></div></div><section class=\"styles_reviewContentwrapper__K2aRu\" aria-disabled=\"false\"><div class=\"styles_reviewHeader__DzoAZ\" data-service-review-rating=\"1\"><div class=\"star-rating_starRating__sdbkn star-rating_medium__Oj7C9\"><img alt=\"Rated 1 out of 5 stars\" src=\"https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg\"/></div></div><div class=\"styles_reviewContent__tuXiN\" aria-hidden=\"false\" data-review-content=\"true\"><a href=\"/reviews/6827c99525ff806d2b0eb833\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_self\" class=\"link_internal__Eam_b typography_appearance-inherit__YnCNb link_link__jBdLV link_notUnderlined__y4Qsc\" data-review-title-typography=\"true\"><h2 class=\"typography_heading-xs__osRhC typography_appearance-default__t8iAq\" data-service-review-title-typography=\"true\">Getting screwes</h2></a><p class=\"typography_body-l__v5JLj typography_appearance-default__t8iAq\" data-service-review-text-typography=\"true\">I was contacted by the Amazon delivery driver while I was at work asking me for something called a PASS CODE which I have never heard of. The driver told me that it would either be in a text message or email which it was no in either. So, the driver told me that he could not deliver it even though he was sitting in my driveway at the time. I called customer service to get an immediate refund so I could go to a store to purchase this item instead. I have never been more aggravated in my entire life. First they told me it was going to be 3 to 5 business days before I received my refund, that is not acceptable! They removed the funds from my account when the order shipped, why can&#x27;t I get a refund as soon as they take back possession of the item? Their financial department was even worse to deal with than their customer service.

Your system failed to deliver it on time, and without my authorization, the order was canceled.<br/><br/>I contacted customer service and explained clearly that I needed my refund immediately, because I had to re-buy everything you failed to deliver. After waiting a long time on the call, the representative told me—sarcastically—“I have good news.”<br/><br/>I thought she had truly resolved the issue. But her “good news” was that I’ll receive my refund tomorrow after 10 p.m.<br/><br/>What am I supposed to do with that money after the event is over?<br/><br/>That is not a solution. That is just further delay.<br/><br/>And this is not the first time it happens — a previous order for an important occasion was also delayed and canceled by Amazon. You’ve failed me twice now.<br/><br/>I don’t want apologies. I want real solutions. I want my refund NOW, not when it’s no longer useful.</p><p class=\"typography_body-m__k2UI7 typography_appearance-default__t8iAq\" data-service-review-date-of-experience-typography=\"true\"><b

He said he delivered all 3 to one of the apartments below. \\\\n\\\\nI ran out and quickly found out that both of my packages were dumped in front of someone else’s apartment door. I quickly retrieved them and I confronted the driver. He didn’t apologize, he said that’s where they “pinged” (whatever that means). Mind you, my packages had my full name and address on it, including MY apartment number. I was very frustrated. The driver walked away without any apology, seemingly not even understand what he did wrong.\\\\n\\\\nI immediately called Amazon customer service to file a report on this unprofessional driver but was met by some Indian dude who could barely speak English and the whole time he thought I have an issue with an item instead of a driver. \\\\n\\\\nAmazon is completely useless. There needs to be a DIRECT way to report all these unprofessional, obviously retarded and lazy drivers. Instead, Amazon keeps covering for them! \",\"rating\":1,\"labels\":{\"merged\":null,\"verification\":{\"isVerified\":false,\"createdDateTime\":\"2025-05-17T21:15:39.000Z\",\"reviewSourceName\":\"Organic\",\"verificationSource\":\"invitation\",\"verificationLevel\":\"not-verified\",\"hasDachExclusion\":false}},\"title\":\"Unable to report an unprofessional Amazon driver\",\"likes\":0,\"source\":\"Organic\",\"dates\":{\"experiencedDate\":\"2025-05-17T00:00:00.000Z\",\"publishedDate\":\"2025-05-17T21:15:39.000Z\",\"updatedDate\":\"2025-05-17T21:25:57.000Z\",\"submittedDate\":null},\"report\":null,\"hasUnhandledReports\":false,\"consumer\":{\"id\":\"651f9658b151090011f33bc4\",\"displayName\":\"Anna\",\"imageUrl\":\"\",\"numberOfReviews\":5,\"countryCode\":\"US\",\"hasImage\":false,\"isVerified\":false},\"reply\":null,\"consumersReviewCountOnSameDomain\":2,\"consumersReviewCountOnSameLocation\":null,\"productReviews\":[],\"language\":\"en\",\"location\":null},{\"id\":\"6828d97b67f9019ae02cfd85\",\"filtered\":false,\"pending\":false,\"text\":\"I have always found Amazon easy to work with and very reliable as far as quality is concerned.  i have always received items on time -or sooner\",\"rating\":5,\"labels\":{\"merged\":null,\"verification\":{\"isVerified\":false,\"createdDateTime\":\"2025-05-17T20:46:19.000Z\",\"reviewSourceName\":\"Organic\",\"verificationSource\":\"invitation\",\"verificationLevel\":\"not-verified\",\"hasDachExclusion\":false}},\"title\":\"I have always found Amazon easy to work…\",\"likes\":0,\"source\":\"Organic\",\"dates\":{\"experiencedDate\":\"2025-05-04T00:00:00.000Z\",\"publishedDate\":\"2025-05-17T20:46:19.000Z\",\"updatedDate\":null,\"submittedDate\":null},\"report\":null,\"hasUnhandledReports\":false,\"consumer\":{\"id\":\"58d19c310000ff000a84194d\",\"displayName\":\"Ian\",\"imageUrl\":\"\",\"numberOfReviews\":15,\"countryCode\":\"GB\",\"hasImage\":false,\"isVerified\":false},\"reply\":null,\"consumersReviewCountOnSameDomain\":1,\"consumersReviewCountOnSameLocation\":null,\"productReviews\":[],\"language\":\"en\",\"location\":null},{\"id\":\"6828d1c5758344ee57d4df40\",\"filtered\":false,\"pending\":false,\"text\":\"I have given Amazon 1 star because of the lies they tell you.
